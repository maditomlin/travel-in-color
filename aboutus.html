    <p>Travel'in COLOR was founded in 2019 by Madi Tomlin and Katelyn Lam. The website was created as a personal project for the Kode with Klossy Summer 2019 Coding Camp. Travel’in COLOR is a color and city organized photo gallery that shows amazing picturesque places, the location of each place, and directions to the location. We created Travel’in COLOR to be easy to navigate and user friendly. The website is directed to photographers, millennials, and gen zer’s  but can be used by anyone.
